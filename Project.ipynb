        "Depression is one of the difficult mental illnesses, and is one of the most common in the US. Over 10 million people suffer from depression alone and that number is steadily rising. Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. Depression can be caused by many things including: faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, medical problems, and chemical imbalances. It's a dangerous state of mind and the more we understand it the better."
